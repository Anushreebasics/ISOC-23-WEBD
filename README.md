# ISOC'23 Web Development Track: Popularising Local Artifacts - An Open Source Challenge

## Project Overview

I created a ContactUs page along with error checks and light and dark mode which empower users with the ability to seamlessly switch between light and dark modes, thereby elevating their browsing experience.

Also made a ticket booking page for the exhibitions and also giving a feature to remove the bookings.
