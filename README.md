# ISOC'23 Web Development Track: Popularising Local Artifacts - An Open Source Challenge

## Project Overview

I created a ContactUs page along with error checks and light and dark mode which empower users with the ability to seamlessly switch between light and dark modes, thereby elevating their browsing experience.

Also made a ticket booking page for the exhibitions and also giving a feature to remove the bookings.

### Issues solved

IssueNo.1. **Toggle Light and Dark Mode:** Empower users with the ability to seamlessly switch between light and dark modes, thereby elevating their browsing experience. But in the contact page itself.

IssueNo.7. **Contact Us:** Establish a "Contact Us" section equipped with a robust database for efficiently managing inquiries and user feedback.

IssueNo.9. **Ticket Booking System:** Implement a robust ticket booking system frontend, allowing users to purchase tickets for exhibitions and manage their bookings.
